# Editing, Saving, and Closing Files in Nano

## **Editing in Nano**

Nano is intuitive and straightforward, making it an excellent tool for text editing. Here’s how to perform common editing tasks:

### Basic Text Manipulation
- **Insert Text**: Simply type to add text at the cursor’s position.
- **Delete Text**: Use the Backspace key to delete the character before the cursor, or the Delete key to remove the character under the cursor.
- **Cut and Paste Text**: To cut a line, use `Ctrl+K`. To paste the cut text back into the document, place the cursor at the desired location and press `Ctrl+U`.

### Search and Replace
- **Searching for Text**: Press `Ctrl+W` and type the search query. Press Enter to execute the search.
- **Replacing Text**: Use `Ctrl+\` to open the search and replace interface. Enter the search term, press Enter, then type the replacement text and press Enter again.

### Undo and Redo
- **Undoing Actions**: Press `Alt+U` to undo the last action.
- **Redoing Actions**: Press `Alt+E` to redo the action.

## **Saving Files in Nano**

### Saving Changes
To save the changes you’ve made to a file, press `Ctrl+O`. Nano will display the file name. Press Enter to confirm and save the file.

### Save As
To save the current file with a different name, press `Ctrl+O`, then edit the filename at the prompt and press Enter to save.

### Automatic Backups
Nano can be configured to automatically save backup copies of the file. This is done by adding the `--backup` option when starting Nano or setting it in the Nano configuration file.

## **Closing Files in Nano**

### Exiting Nano
To exit Nano, press `Ctrl+X`. If there are unsaved changes, Nano will ask whether to save the changes. Press `Y` to save and exit, or `N` to exit without saving.

### Forced Exit
To exit Nano immediately without saving changes, press `Ctrl+X`, then `N` when prompted to save.
