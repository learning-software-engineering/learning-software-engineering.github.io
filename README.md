## Intro
Welcome to Learning Software Engineering Repository. This is intended as a resource for students new to software engineering to contribute to the ever growing body of knowledge of software engineering by adding/editing their input to help other students learn better. 
Readers are expected to know the foundation of software engineering and computer science (e.g., basics of algorithms, foundations of programming).

Following files are present in this directory. You may contribute to any of these of your choice. If you are contributing by forming multiple pages, consider structuring your files into a new sub-directory within the topic's directory. Contribute to the readme files within each topic directory as appropriate.
