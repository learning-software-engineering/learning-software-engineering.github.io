Provided are basic descriptions of each agile methodology. If you are interested in learning about these topics in more detail please click on them for in more in depth pages.
* [Lean](./../Software_Engineering/Lean.md): Lean principles focus on eliminating waste and maximizing value delivery. It emphasizes continuous improvement, customer focus, and minimizing work in progress.
* [Kanban](./../Software_Engineering/Kanban.md): Kanban is a visual framework for managing work, often used in Agile development. It emphasizes visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow.
* MVC (Minimum Viable Product): MVC is a strategy for developing products with the minimum set of features needed to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development.
* [Scrum](./../Software_Engineering/Scrum.md): Scrum is an Agile framework that emphasizes iterative development, regular inspection, and adaptation. It divides work into time-boxed iterations called sprints, with a focus on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.

## Agile Product Planning & Prioritization
