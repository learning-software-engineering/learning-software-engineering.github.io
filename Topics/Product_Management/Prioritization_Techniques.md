## Introduction

Effective prioritization lies at the core of successful product management, demanding a keen understanding of which tasks deserve priority. The art of prioritization can be the difference between crafting a polished minimum viable product and merely assembling an arbitrary assortment of features. In the realm of software development, two notable techniques stand out for their efficacy: the MoSCoW method and the Kano model. These methodologies offer invaluable frameworks for product managers, guiding teams through the intricate process of determining priorities and ensuring that essential foundations are laid before delving into additional features.

## The MoSCoW Method

Firstly, the MoSCoW method, an acronym derived from Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves, serves as a powerful tool in the arsenal of product managers for prioritizing tasks. This technique categorizes requirements into four distinct priority levels, helping teams streamline decision-making. Must-haves represent non-negotiable essentials, forming the backbone of a project. These would be features related to the MVP. Should-haves are crucial but not critical, offering flexibility in scheduling. Normally, tasks that the client would like, but are not included in the MVP. Could-haves encompass desirable but optional features. These could be features that the client might want, but could do without them. While Won't-haves, as the name implies, denote consciously deferred items. These either will not work for whatever reason, or do not meet the time limit. Implementing this technique is simple and involves collaborative sessions where the team collectively assigns priorities to each requirement, fostering a shared understanding of project objectives. By employing the MoSCoW method, teams gain clarity, align on priorities, and efficiently allocate resources, enhancing the likelihood of delivering a product that meets both user expectations and business needs.

## The Kano Method

The Kano model, developed by Professor Noriaki Kano, is a nuanced technique for product development prioritization. It categorizes features into three main types: Basic Needs, Performance Needs, and Delighters. Basic Needs are fundamental requirements that, when met, prevent dissatisfaction but don't necessarily contribute to satisfaction when exceeded. This is the perfect example of what the MVP represents, the client would expect this completed, but won’t be overly happy as its the minimum expectation. Performance Needs directly correlate satisfaction with their level of fulfillment—higher performance leads to greater satisfaction. Delighters are unexpected features that, when included, can significantly elevate user satisfaction. These include going above and beyond client expectations. Such as, implementing features that were not mentioned, but could greatly improve the product. Implementing the Kano model involves surveying users to categorize features and determine their impact on satisfaction. If this is not possible you could alternatively survey the client and try to gauge what he deems important. This method not only aids in prioritizing features based on their potential to enhance user experience but also guides teams in understanding the emotional and functional aspects that shape user preferences. By integrating the Kano model into your processes, product managers empower teams to make informed decisions that resonate with user expectations and contribute to long-term customer satisfaction.

## Which Is Right For ME?
Choosing between the MoSCoW method and the Kano model depends on project characteristics and priorities. The MoSCoW method is straightforward, ideal for teams requiring clear, essential features prioritization, especially for MVP development with tight deadlines or specific client needs. In contrast, the Kano model excels in projects prioritizing user satisfaction and experience. This strategy is extremely beneficial for teams seeking to determine essential minimum-threshold features for prioritization, identify performance features that should be invested early on, and recognize customer-delight features that offer the most delight for effort. The decision between these methods hinges on project goals, constraints, and the emphasis on either clear-cut prioritization or user-centric, emotionally resonant feature development.

## Conclusion

Regardless of your chosen prioritization technique, be it MoSCoW or the Kano model, both prove undeniably valuable in guiding teams toward successful project outcomes. Whether prioritizing with categorical precision or focusing on user satisfaction, these approaches empower informed decision-making, ensuring resources are allocated judiciously and products align with user expectations. Implement these techniques to help provide structure and clarity to your projects.
