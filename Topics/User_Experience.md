## Resources for User Experience domain

### Overview

User Experience (UX) is a large and broad topic. It covers the overall experience of the user and how they interact with software systems and applications. The main focus of User Experience is to make a piece of software accessible, easy to follow (ie: user-friendly) and adaptable to the user's needs. There is no set of standard rules that make up a "great" user experience, as it often differs on the product and the consumers that are using the products. User Experience is not to be confused with UI and UX Design. While these topics have similarities with User Experience, they are also different in their ways. For example, UI could be how the interface is designed whereas UX is more about how users interact with the said design. Many notable links are differentiating the two areas. Here is one of the related websites.

### Accessibility Features of User Experience

There are some things that have become a crucial part in making a software: Universal Design Principles. 

___The 7 Universal Design Principles___
- [Universal Design Principles](https://www.buffalo.edu/access/help-and-support/topic3/universaldesignprinciples.html): Universal Design Principles are not only used for software, but can be incorporated generally as well.

### Helpful Courses

There are many courses related to User Experience. This includes the U of T Course [The Design of Interactive Computational Media](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc318h1) which is highly recommended if interested in this topic. [The Design of Interactive Computational Media](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc318h1) expands on the work done before coding projects. For example, one of the projects is testing how users would interact with a prototype of a UI and modifying it so that the UX is better for the user.


### Tools Can Be Used In UX Design

In addition to Bootstrap, Ant Design is another popular UI library and design system. It is specifically designed for React applications and other frontend frameworks like Vue, Angular and etc, providing a complete set of high-quality React components that make user interface development simpler, more consistent, and modular. Ant Design is ideal for building enterprise-level applications and dashboards with a focus on high performance, usability, and aesthetics.

Ant Design provides a wide range of UI components, including buttons, icons, form elements, tables, and navigation menus. It also offers a consistent design language, making it easier for developers to create appealing user interfaces. The design ensures that your applications look great on different devices and screen sizes. More importantly, it is easy to use for beginners. Following steps are provided for you to start using Ant Design in your project.

First, you need to install Ant Design in your React application. You can do this by running the following command (also you can use yarn command to install, here I provide method using npm):

**npm install antd**

Next, you may want to import the components you want to use in your application. For example, if you want to change the style for your button in a webpage, simply import Button from antd package.

**import { Button } from 'antd';**

Finally, you are almost done. All you need to do is use the imported components in your application. For example, below code is a example using Button from antd package:

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Button type="primary">Click me!</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


Besides, Ant Design allows you to customize the default theme by modifying the less variables. For instance, you can use tools like 'craco-less' or 'react-app-rewired' to customize your theme without ejecting from Create React App.
