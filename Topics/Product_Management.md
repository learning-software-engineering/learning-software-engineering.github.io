## Resources for Product Management

### Beginner's guide to product management and becoming a successful product manager
Product management is an essential part of the software development lifecycle, as much a key part as the technical side to software engineering. The essence of product management is to be able to develop a new product, with a clearly defined roadmap and goals/milestones outlined from the requirements of the customer - keeping a clear view of the overall vision and strategy. This is different to the role of a project manager, who is responsible for the internal organization and operation of the development team, to make sure goals are achieved and timelines are met. 

Some key features of a successful product manager:
* Able to efficiently and clearly prioritize tasks.
* Understand the product, people and environment that you are working with.
* Guide your development team without being authoritative.
* If you are making tradeoffs, be sure to explain and outline the opportunity cost.

##### Prioritize Tasks
Before confirming the priorities of all parts, the team should communicate sufficiently with the partner to understand their primary needs and the essential features of the product. After understanding the product functions, the team should conceptualize the product structure, clarifying the hierarchical relationship between the functions, and design the workflow. Once these steps are completed, please discuss your ideas with the partner to ensure the overall framework is not misaligned.

In terms of feature implementation, for small and medium-sized projects, I recommend starting with the essential features and implementing them from top to bottom to ensure effective operation. After demonstrating these features to the partner, expand the project based on them. Generally speaking, the partner's primary needs are often the difficulties of the project. Once these are completed, the implementation of other parts will be easier to resolve.

##### When there are non-working members within the team

First, talk to the person to understand the reason, and make sure not to create conflicts during this process. If it becomes clear that they are simply not working or finding excuses not to work, do not isolate them. Assign tasks as usual, but do not allocate critical and necessary parts of the project to them. While working, keep a clear record of each team member's accomplishments. When it can be sufficiently proven that the non-working member has not contributed or has been perfunctory, write an email to the leader (professor). Additionally, when presenting the work results to the partner, ask each person to showcase and introduce their part of the work.
