## Resources for Product Management

### What does product manager do?
There is a [guide on what the product manager does](https://www.productplan.com/learn/what-is-product-management/), and one of the introductory and key concepts has been extracted as follows:

Most product professionals spend the majority of their time focused on the following:
* __**Conducting Research:**__ Researching to gain expertise about the company’s market, user personas, and competitors.
* __**Developing Strategy:**__ Shaping the industry knowledge they’ve learned into a high-level strategic plan for their product—including goals and objectives, a broad-strokes overview of the product itself, and maybe a rough timeline.
* __**Communicating Plans:**__ Developing a working strategic plan using a product roadmap and presenting it to key stakeholders across their organization: executives, investors, development teams, etc. Ongoing communication across their cross-functional teams throughout the development process and beyond.
* __**Coordinating Development:**__ Assuming they have received a green light to move forward with their product’s strategic plan, coordinate with the relevant teams—product marketing, development, etc.—to begin executing the plan.
* __**Acting on Feedback and Data Analysis:**__ Finally, after building, testing, and introducing the product to the marketplace, learning via data analysis and soliciting direct feedback from users, what works, what doesn’t, and what to add. Working with the relevant teams to incorporate this feedback into future product iterations.

### How should CSC301 students perform product management?
The following actions are what CSC301 students can do on performing product management. As the course goes, you will find out that the course assignments and deliverables are already helping with the management process. Thus, it is important to follow the assignment instructions carefully in order to become a good product manager.
* __**Conducting Research:**__ Read carefuly about the project proposal, meet with the partner for a talk, and go to the partner's official website to learn about the purpose of their organization, what they want to show the users, and in what form (e.g. website, mobile app, etc.). 

Key take aways from CSC301 Week 2 lecture for this part:
** Review your high-level English description
** Who are your users?
** What is the objective?
** Why would they use the product?
Note that the focus is the problem and users, not the product.

* __**Developing Strategy:**__ Divide the whole project team into two or three sub-teams, for example, a team working on frontend, a team working on backend, and a team solving overall technical problems both teams are facing. In each team, document about how they will implement the project based on the research you previously done to achieve the goals. A flow chart or an overview diagram can help with organizing high-level strategic plan and demo to your partner in future meetings.

Key take aways from CSC301 Week 2 lecture for this part:
** Do you know what problem your partner wants to solve?
** Has your partner prescribed a solution?

Remember: We only talk about the problem we want to solve. We don’t say what the product is.

* __**Communicating Plans:**__ Holding regular meetings with your partner to report on the project progress, showing them the user stories you come up with to have their agreement, exchange thoughts and obtain feedbacks. In each meeting with partner, make sure to have at least one team mate responsible for each of frontend and backend to note down the feedbacks, so that they can later work with other teammates on corresponding parts.

Key take aways from CSC301 Week 2 lecture for this part:
** Use Personas to simplify communication and empathize with user groups
** User Stories is a good method to think about requirements from the user's prospective, using everyday language.
** Write down acceptance criteria for each user story, that are conditions that your product must satisfy to be accepted by the uer in the user story. Be specific with this.

* __**Coordinating Development:**__ All subteams in your project team now can work together along the process to merge the parts, and testing on the functions that you would like your project to have. Document down any modifications in your strategy plan that you generated in previous steps for future reference.

Key take aways from CSC301 Week 2 lecture for this part:
** [Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/ui-design/what-is-prototyping/): Show what it looks like, how it works, and see if your users get it and can work with it (potentially your TAs for this course, because they would be marking based on your deployed project.)
** [Artifacts](https://draw.chat/index.html): Use tools such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and [Moqups](https://moqups.com/) to generate mockups and wireframes for your product
** Other resources: [CRC cards](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm), [Class Diagrams](http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/classDiagram.htm)

* __**Acting on Feedback and Data Analysis:**__ Demo the product to your partner to get their feedbacks, ask for their advice, and improve on the product. 

### Difference between managing product and platform
In software engineering, managing products and platforms are two different approaches to creating and delivering software solutions.

Product management focuses on creating and managing a specific software product that meets the needs of a specific customer or market segment. The product manager is responsible for defining the features, functionality, and user experience of the product, as well as its pricing, positioning, and promotion. The product manager is also responsible for ensuring that the product is delivered on time and within budget, and for monitoring its performance and making adjustments as necessary.

Platform management, on the other hand, focuses on creating a reusable software platform that can be used to develop and deliver multiple products or solutions. The platform manager is responsible for defining the architecture, APIs, and development tools of the platform, as well as its governance and security policies. The platform manager is also responsible for ensuring that the platform is scalable, reliable, and easy to use, and for fostering a community of developers who can leverage the platform to create innovative solutions.
