## Resources for Product Management

### Beginner's guide to product management and becoming a successful product manager
Product management is an essential part of the software development lifecycle, as much a key part as the technical side to software engineering. The essence of product management is to be able to develop a new product, with a clearly defined roadmap and goals/milestones outlined from the requirements of the customer - keeping a clear view of the overall vision and strategy. This is different to the role of a project manager, who is responsible for the internal organization and operation of the development team, to make sure goals are achieved and timelines are met. 

Some key features of a successful product manager:
* Able to efficiently and clearly prioritize tasks.
* Understand the product, people and environment that you are working with.
* Guide your development team without being authoritative.
* If you are making tradeoffs, be sure to explain and outline the opportunity cost.
