#### React Native Core Components ScrollView
* [Learn ScrollView](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#alwaysbouncehorizontal-ios)
    * **Learn ScrollView** is an official React Native documentation for ScrollView. Like any React Native components, ScrollView can be customized with their parameter called **props**. These props, unlike some other components of React Native are however unique to iOS - although it doesn't raise error upon compiling, the Android version would not output the customization. The documentation allows for programmers to carefully pick their props so that both Android and iOS version will output the same visualization according to the front-end developer's wish.
