## Resources for Teamwork

## Communication


Communication is one of the most essential parts of a successful software engineering team. This is because software engineering teams are often composed of multiple individuals with a diverse set of skills, experiences, schedules and responsibilites. Clear communication helps team members divide work efficiently, ensuring that each member has a clear understanding of their responsibilities and deadlines. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and leads to smoother collaborations and faster delivery.
