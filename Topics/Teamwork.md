## Resources for Teamwork



### Using Kanban Boards

Whether it's GitHub Projects, Trello, Asana or Jira, if you're working with a software development team, there's a good chance you will be working with a Kanban board for your project management.

Using them effectively as a team is a combination of keeping things clear for yourself, and clear for others.

Kanban boards are different from a personal to-do list in that they are shared with a team and updated all the time. This all-encompassing nature has the advantage that anyone can check the board and see what is being worked on and at what stage, but has the prerequisite that of clear wording and being constantly updated to ensure clarity. Setting [SMART goals](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) become essential, ensuring everyone else has a clear idea of what you're working on.

Overall, with a bit more emphasis on logging and tracking, Kanban boards provide the perfect medium for a team to collaborate on. As a final note, remember that these are just tools to supplement collaboration. Some things can't be replaced by a quick conversation or a direct message.
