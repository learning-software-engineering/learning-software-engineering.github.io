# Resources for Teamwork

## Forming a Team
When first forming a team, it is important for all members to get to know one another as this will allow each member to feel more comfortable communicating while working together. It is highly recommended that teams meet prior to starting the project to simply get aquainted with one another. Although this meeting should be more personal (i.e. unrelated to the project), it can also be used to establish the group's goals and expectations to ensure everyone has a similar mindset going into the project. 

It is also extremely useful for team members to identify the specific skill sets that they can bring to the team, including any relevant soft skills and technical experience. These strengths should be shared with the team to help with the decisions making when delegating roles and responsibilities. 

## Project Management
Working as a team effectively requires a lot of planning and organization. Projects as a whole are often very complicated and overwhelming, so it is very useful to break down a project into smaller stages/tasks. There are many ways in which a project can be managed; two commons project management practices that software engineering teams user are the Waterfall and Agile methods. Details on these can be found in [Resources for Software Engineers](https://learning-software-engineering.github.io/Topics/Software_Engineering.html#resources-for-software-engineering).

## Team Communication
During the early stages of forming a team, the group should also establish general expectations for how the team plans to communicate with one another. This may include setting up a team communication channel on a specific platform (ex. discord or slack) and establishing regular check-up meetings (including when these meetings are and where they will be held - for example, in person or online). These general meetings can be used to outline general expectations and project requirements, update one another on individual progress, delegate new reponsibilities, and set project deadlines. 

An important part of team communication is in communicating tasks, deadlines and progress. Each team member should have good knowledge of the general progress of the project. This will give each team member a deeper understanding of the current state of the project so that they can more adequetly allocate their time. Perhaps even more importantly, the project manager will be able to have a deeper understanding of the progress of the project, and the team member's working habits and they will be able to manage the team more adequetly.

With a deeper understanding of the project progress, project managers will be able to assign more realistic dates and deadlines, and keep team members on task and on the right tasks. With a deeper understanding of their team member's working habits they can also more adequetly update stakeholders amd allocate budget. This will help avoid unforseen issues while approaching deadlines. For instance, if a project lead notices that their team is lagging behind on a task for a specific deadline, then they will be able to correctly reassess the deadline, and the deeper insight will allow him to more accurately set future deadlines.

In general, when setting goals for your team as a project manager, there are many things to consider, such as the clarity of the goal, the fact that it is a realistic goal, and that the goal is relevant and important to your project. Proper communication with your team members will aid in acheiving each of these goals, and correctly following these tips will help your team reach their goals and provide a better product to your client. In this process, organization is key, and a project manager must try to leverage all the tools available to him to improve his ability to manage the team. When it comes to deadline-setting and task prioritizing, one of the most powerful tools that a manager can use is a todo list or project board/roadmap.

There are many useful options for this, such as [Notion](https://notion.notion.site/Product-roadmap-c5e8829bb9644dd08c576452ee200404) and [Trello](https://trello.com/b/1x4Uql2u/project-management). Both of these tools allow a project manager and their team to create a page, that they can all access to check important tasks and notes about those tasks.

Here is an example progress board given by Trello:

You may notice that there are several states for each task, from 'To Do' to 'Done' or even 'Blocked.' This allows the team to understand the progress of all their tasks, and even if a task was stopped. You will also notice that there are team members assigned to some tasks which gives clear communication to the whole team about who is working on what. As you can see, there is a lot of information that a project manager can gain through this kind of tool, and it will all help them with being able to guide their team as described above.


### Getting Clarification
You always want to ensure that all team members are on the same page when working together. If you are ever unsure about something that was said during a meeting or have any confusions in general, ask your team members with specific and explicit questions. It is helpful to reiterate your understanding back to the team to confirm your understanding is correct. Some example phrases you may use (taken from [Week 8 Lecture Slide 12](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/293515/files/25224801/download?download_frd=1)) includes:
- "Can you please clarify..."
- "I didn't get the part about..."
- "What do you mean by..."
- "How would ... work?"
- "What are the next steps?"

### Giving and Receiving Feedback 
When team members are working on different components of a project, it is useful to have meetings where each member can share their work with the rest of the team. During this meeting, constructive feedback can be given to make improvements and offer new insights/perspectives. Feedback should be given early on (for instnace, while an idea is being formulated rather than after it has been fully implemented). Try to be specific when giving feedback by specifying what exactly in the project the feedback is regarding and your opinion is on how it can be improved or what potential issues you may see. In a professional working environment, always ensure feedback is being given with the purpose of supporting the team's goals and improving the project rather than being influenced by any negative emotions. On the other hand, is it good to practice being open and receptive of feedback - understand that everyone has different experiences and opinions and their feedback is not meant to be a criticism but a suggestion that you and the team can benefit from.

## Communication


Communication is one of the most essential parts of a successful software engineering team. This is because software engineering teams are often composed of multiple individuals with a diverse set of skills, experiences, schedules and responsibilites. Clear communication helps team members divide work efficiently, ensuring that each member has a clear understanding of their responsibilities and deadlines. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and leads to smoother collaborations and faster delivery.

Communication is essential for positive collaboration. In software engineering different problems can arise and effective communication is key to resolving them quickly. By discussing issues openly and honestly, team members can brainstorm solutions and use their collective expertise to work together and resolve issues in a timely manner. This leads to the development of high-quality software products. 

Some examples of effective communication include [active listening](https://myseco.militaryonesource.mil/portal/article/active-listening-in-the-workplace), timely communication, clear messages and honest feedback.

Team members must update each other on their ideas, progress and any obstacles they might be facing in their work. Otherwise, there might be a drop in productivity and even a delay in the project. If a team member is facing issues it is important for them to discuss these with their co-workers as they might be able to help resolve the issue. 

Communication is integral for voicing your concerns to your team members. Team members should express their concerns with each other respectfully and resolve these concerns in a professional and constructive manner. This maintains an important sense of accountability between the team members.

Effective communication is crucial for any software engineering team to work well together and achieve their goals in a timely and organized manner. It can, however, be difficult to communicate with your team due to a number of challenges. In a globalized workplace, where employees come from different cultural backgrounds, language barriers can pose significant challenges and can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations.

Letting your emotions overwhelm you can also hinder effective communication in the workplace. Emotions such as anxiety, stress, and anger can all negatively impact communication and professional relationships. It is essential for team members to work together on overcoming these challnges to maintain a productive and healthy work enviornment.

## Conflict Resolution

Working effectively in a team setting is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of software engineering. Conflicts can arise in any team, and how they are resolved can have a significant impact on the team's success. Effective conflict resolution fosters a collaborative and supportive team environment where everyone's contributions are valued, and disagreements are handled constructively.

[Avoiding Conflicts](https://dev.to/codesphere/resolving-conflicts-within-your-dev-team-1hfh)

An important first step towards conflict resolution is learning how to avoid them in the first place. This article details possible steps to avoid many common conflicts that arise in a team setting, including managing expectations by setting clear goals and proper training, and maintaining healthy lines of communication between team members.

[Resolving Conflicts](https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/conflict-resolution-at-work)

It is not always possible to avoid conflict. In work environment when people are exchanging ideas and working towards goals, a difference of opinion is inevitable. However, if handled properly, these conflicts can be resolved while keeping the negative impacts at a minimum, and even help create a better solution for the project at hand. This article covers ways that the parties in a conflict can help each other understand their own points of view, while keeping discourse respectful. It emphasizes ways that team members can help each other work towards a common goal.


## Handling Non-responsive Team Members

Handling a non-responsive and unmotivated team member in software engineering can be especially challenging due to the importance of collaboration and communication in the development process. There are several steps that can be taken to increase the chances of the conflict being resolved peacefully:

1. First, the team leader or manager should schedule a meeting with the team member to discuss their concerns and understand the root cause of their lack of motivation. It could be due to a variety of factors such as workload, personal issues or lack of interest in the project. 
2. Once the root cause is identified, the leader should work with the team member to develop a plan to improve their performance, such as redefining their role, providing training or mentorship or reassigning tasks. 
3. Additionally, the team leader can try to increase the team member's motivation by setting clear goals and providing feedback, recognition and incentives for their contributions. 

However, if the team member continues to be non-responsive and unmotivated despite efforts to help them, the leader may need to consider alternative solutions such as disciplinary action or reassignment to a different project or team. This, of course, is the worst-case scenario. And while this should not happen frequently given that all the team members are mature enough to resolve the conflict without getting to this point, it does still occur — both in work placements and school courses.
