## Resources for Teamwork


### Using Kanban Boards

Whether its GitHub Projects, Trello, Asana or Jira, if you're working with a software development team, there's a good chance you will be working with a Kanban board for your project management.

Using them effectively as a team is a combination of keeping things clear for yourself, and clear for others.

Kanban boards are different from a personal todo-list in that they are shared with a team and updated all the time. This all-encompassing nature has the advantage that anyone can check the board and see what is being worked on and at what stage, but has the pre-requisite that of clear wording and being constantly updated to ensure clarity. Setting [SMART goals](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals) become essential, ensuring everyone else has a clear idea of what you're working on.

Overall, with a bit more emphasis on logging and tracking, Kanban boards provide the perfect medium for a team to collaborate on. As a final note, remember that these are just tools to supplement collaboration. Some things can't be replaced by a quick conversation or a direct message.
