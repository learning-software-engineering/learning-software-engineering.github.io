## Resources for User Research domain

### Overview

User research is an essential part of the user experience (UX) design process. It involves gathering information about users and their needs, behaviors, and attitudes through various research methods. The goal of user research is to create a user-centered design by understanding the needs and goals of the users and incorporating this information into the design process. the key topics in user research include User Personas, User Testing, Surveys and Questionnaires, Interviews, and Contextual Inquiry.

User research can be conducted through various methods, such as surveys, interviews, focus groups, usability testing, and ethnographic studies. These methods allow researchers to gather information about users' experiences, behaviors, and preferences, which can then be used to inform design decisions.

### Key Topics in User Research

1. User Personas: User personas are fictional representations of your target users. They help you understand the needs, goals, and behaviors of your users, which can inform the design of your product. Creating user personas involves conducting research to gather information about your users, such as demographic data, behavioral patterns, and attitudes.

Example: I want to study space finder application, I would create a user persona first for the UX

Step 1: Define a user: our user is likely to be a student or working professional who is looking for a quiet, comfortable, and productive space to study or work.

Step 2: Gather information: To create a user persona, we need to gather information about our target users' needs, goals, and behaviors. This could involve conducting surveys, interviews, or user testing. Some questions to consider include:

- What type of user is most likely to use your app?

- What features are most important to them in a study space? (e.g. wifi, power outlets, comfortable seating, quiet environment, etc.)

- What are their pain points when it comes to finding a good study space? (e.g. lack of availability, noise, uncomfortable seating, etc.)

Step 3: Create a profile: Based on the information you have gathered, create a profile of your user. This should include demographic information, such as age, gender, and occupation, as well as behavioral information, such as goals, needs, and pain points. For example:

Name: Emily

Age: 20

Occupation: UTSG student

Goals: Find a quiet and productive study space that is close to campus

Needs: Comfortable seating, wifi, power outlets, quiet environment

Pain Points: Limited availability of study spaces, noisy environments, uncomfortable seating


2. User Testing: User testing involves observing and gathering feedback from users as they interact with your product. This can be done through various methods, such as in-person interviews, remote testing, or A/B testing. The goal of user testing is to identify usability issues, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.

Example: We have finished our prototype for study space finder application, we need to conduct a user testing then.

Step 1: Identify the testing goals: Before conducting user testing, you need to identify the goals I want to achieve. For example, I might want to test the ease of use of the app, the effectiveness of the search function, and the relevance of the search results.

Step 2: Recruit participants: Next, I need to recruit participants for the user testing. To do this, I can reach out to your target user base, such as college students or working professionals who are looking for study spaces. I could also offer incentives, such as a gift card or free coffee, to encourage participation.

Step 3: Create a testing plan: Once I have recruited participants, create a plan for the user testing. This should include a list of tasks for participants to complete, such as searching for a study space near a specific location, and a set of questions to gather feedback on the app's usability and functionality.

Step 4: Conduct the user testing: With the plan in place, conduct the user testing. This can be done in-person or remotely, depending on our needs and resources. As participants interact with the app, observe their behavior and ask them to provide feedback on their experience. Take notes on any usability issues or pain points that arise.

Step 5: Analyze the results: After the user testing is complete, analyze the results to identify common themes and areas for improvement. Look for patterns in the feedback, such as difficulty finding study spaces or confusion with the search function.

Step 6: Make improvements: Based on the results of the user testing, make improvements to the app. This might involve redesigning the search function, adding new features, or improving the user interface.

Step 7: Repeat the process: Finally, repeat the user testing process to test the effectiveness of the improvements we have made. This will help us identify any additional issues and ensure that our app is meeting the needs of our users.

3. Surveys and Questionnaires: Surveys and questionnaires are a way to gather quantitative data about user behavior and preferences. These can be useful for gathering feedback on specific features, understanding user needs, and measuring user satisfaction.

Example: I have compeleted both prototype and user usabilty, and I want to improve my prototype (study space finder application) by listening to the users' experience by surveys/questionaaires.

Step 1: Identify the survey goals: Before creating a survey or questionnaire, you need to identify the goals you want to achieve. For example, you might want to gather feedback on the effectiveness of the search function, the quality of the study spaces listed on the app, and the overall user experience.

Step 2: Design the survey or questionnaire: Once you have identified the goals, design the survey or questionnaire. This could involve asking open-ended questions, such as "What features do you find most useful in a study space?" or using Likert scales to measure user satisfaction.

Step 3: Distribute the survey: Next, distribute the survey or questionnaire to your target user base. This could be done through email, social media, or in-person distribution.

Step 4: Analyze the results: After the survey or questionnaire is complete, analyze the results to identify common themes and areas for improvement. Look for patterns in the feedback, such as common pain points or positive experiences with specific features.

Step 5: Make improvements: Based on the results of the survey or questionnaire, make improvements to the app. This might involve redesigning the search function, adding new study spaces to the app, or improving the user interface.

Step 6: Repeat the process: Finally, repeat the survey or questionnaire process periodically to measure user satisfaction and identify areas for further improvement.

4. Interviews: Interviews involve conducting one-on-one conversations with users to gather qualitative data about their needs, behaviors, and attitudes. Interviews can be structured or unstructured and can be done in-person or remotely. They can provide valuable insights into user motivations and pain points.

5. Contextual Inquiry: Contextual inquiry involves observing and gathering feedback from users as they interact with your product in their natural environment. This can provide valuable insights into how users interact with your product in real-world situations, which can inform the design of your product.
