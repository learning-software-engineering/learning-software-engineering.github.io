# **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics**

## **Introduction**

Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics are general principles for user interface design, which is an essential part of creating a successful user experience. These heuristics are helpful in providing guidelines that can be used in software engineering for creating various forms of software applications. Adhering to these guidelines will allow software engineers to create applications that are accessible, understandable, and usable. 

## **The Heuristics**

### **1: Visbility of system status**
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on within the system, through appropriate feedback that is provided within a reasonable time. Communication between the user and the system allows the user to be aware of what is happening, and make decisions based on this knowledge. 

**Example:** An application provides a loading screen or a progress bar while the user waits for an action to complete.

### **2: Match between system and the real world**
The system should use words, phrases, and concepts that are familiar to the user. Avoid using technical or system-oriented terms, and use real-world conventions that provide information in a natural and logical order that will make sense to the users of the system. If your application relates to things in the real world, ensure that the system accurately matches them.

**Example:** An e-reading application that allows users to "highlight" words and phrases using a bright colour.

### **3: User control and freedom**
Allow users to have an "emergency exit" for when they select certain system functions by mistake and want to return to their original state. Support options for undo and redo so users have more freedom over how they interact with the system. Users will change their minds or make mistakes, and will need a way to go back to the previous state.

**Example:** An application where a user submits a form, if they change their mind or made a mistake, they can undo the submission. 

### **4: Consistency and standards**
Users should not have to guess or assume if different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow design and platform conventions.

**Example:** An application consistently uses an "X" symbol to represent an exit, instead of using a undo button or a back button in some areas.  

### **5: Error prevention**
Design the system to avoid problems from occurring in the first place by eliminating error-prone conditions or offering a solution if an error does occur. If the user makes a mistake, give them the opportunity to confirm if they would like to continue before committing to the action. 

**Example:** When a user clicks exit on an application, a prompt asking "Are you sure you want to exit?" will pop up.

### **6: Recognition rather than recall**
Minimize the user having to memorize and intake a lot of information by making objects, actions, and options clearly visible. The user should not have to remember how to get from one point of the application to another. Instructions for how to use the system should be easily accessible and visible as well if appropriate. 

**Example:** Having a navigation bar on a web application will allow users to go between different tabs without remembering how to get to them. 

### **7: Flexibility and efficiency of use**
Provide accelerators or shortcuts for experienced users so they can complete common interactions in a more efficient manner. This allows both experienced and inexperienced users to utilize the system to their own personal abilities and preferences. This will allow expert users to take advantage of the feature, and newer users can ignore it. 

**Example:** Having a keyboard shortcut for a common interaction on your website. 

### **8: Aesthetic and minimalist design**
Avoid providing unnecessary or irrelevant information to users. Keep dialogue concise and relevant to ensure that users are able to focus on the important aspects of the system and they are not overloaded with information that they don't need. 

**Example:** Having a simple introduction page for the website, that can be expanded upon when the "More Details" button is clicked.

### **9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**
Provide accurate and straightforward error messages to users so they are able to understand and potentially fix the error. Ensure that error messages are written in simple terms, they clearly indicate the issue, and suggest potential fixes. 

**Example:** When the user incorrectly enters their email to log into a website, it gives an error message saying "There is no account with this email associated. Please carefully re-enter your information or sign up."

### **10: Help and documentation**
It is better if a system can be easily used without documentation, but it may be necessary. In the case that your system is complicated and needs instructions, provide clear and concise instructions without any jargon that can be easily understood by new users. Ensure that the help documentation is easily found, searchable, and lists concrete steps. 

**Example:** A web application has a "help" tab with detailed instructions and documentation.
