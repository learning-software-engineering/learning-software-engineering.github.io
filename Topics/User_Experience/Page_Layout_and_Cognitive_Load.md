# **Relationship Between Web/Mobile Application Layout and User Cognitive Load**

## **Introduction**

The layout of a web/mobile application page is essential for the successful completion of tasks carried out by the users. How information is presented can either burder or streamline the user's mental effort for a given task.

## **Norms of Layout**

The arrangement of elements on a screen adheres to certain norms that guide user experience. Consistency in design, intuitive navigation, and adherence to established patterns contribute to a familiar landscape, reducing the cognitive strain on users.
Users, guided by their past experiences, navigate seamlessly when these norms are honored. Furthermore, the placement of essential information following the "F" or "Z" reading patterns caters to users' natural scanning tendencies, enhancing the overall accessibility of content. These norms demonstrate the relationship between design and user expectations.

**Example:** As described in [Scrolling vs. CLicking: Whatâ€™s the Best User Experience?](https://forgeandsmith.com/blog/scrolling-vs-clicking-whats-the-preferred-user-experience/) by Forge and Smith, pagination and clicking is preferred when audiences expect continuous content.


## **Bad Web Design and its Impacts**

[Bad web design](https://usabilitygeek.com/real-effects-bad-web-design/) serves as a stumbling block in the user's digital journey, creating an intricate maze rather than a smooth path. It manifests as a series of design missteps that disrupt the user's cognitive flow, causing unnecessary challenges as they navigate through the application. One prevalent issue lies in inconsistent navigation, where the placement and structure of essential elements, like menus, defy user expectations. This inconsistency forces users into a constant state of recalibration, diverting their attention from the intended purpose of their visit. The resulting confusion not only disrupts the user experience but also significantly increases cognitive load as users struglle with the challenge of adapting to an rapidly-changing virtual environment.

**Example: Information Overload**

A webpage inundated with an excessive amount of information, competing color schemes, and flashy graphics overwhelms users. This visual noise creates a chaotic environment where users must sift through the overabdundance to identify relevant content. The volume of elements battling for attention not only taxes short-term memory but also disrupts the user's ability to concentrate on the core message or task at hand. In this scenario, cognitive load spikes as users clashes with the challenge of refining meaningful information from the digital noise, diminishing the overall quality of their experience.


## **Good Web Design and its Impacts**

[Effective web and mobile app design](https://markovate.com/blog/web-design-for-business/) can enhance the user experience by minimizing cognitive challenges and streamlining interactions. When design adheres to established norms and user expectations, it becomes a facilitator, significantly reducing friction and allowing users to navigate seamlessly through the digital landscape. This collaboration between design and user intuition results in an interface that anticipates and accommodates user needs, creating an environment where cognitive load is minimized, and user engagement is elevated.


**Example: Clear Hierarchies**

Essential elements are prioritized, guiding users through a logical flow of information consumption. For instance, on an e-commerce website, the straightforward hierarchy ensures that product categories are prominently displayed on the homepage, allowing users to navigate effortlessly to find their desired items. This intentional organization not only improves content readability but also minimizes cognitive load by providing users with an intuitive path to explore and make informed decisions. Clear hierarchies transform the user experience into a guided journey, enhancing both comprehension and engagement.
