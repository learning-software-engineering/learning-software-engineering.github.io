# Setting up OpenAI API in Python Project

## Installing Python
To use the OpenAI library you first need to install Python. To test if you have Python installed, navigate to your Terminal or Command line:

* MacOS: Open your Terminal. This can be found in the Applications folder or search for it using Spotlight. 

* Windows: Open your Command Prompt by searching "cmd" in the start menu.

Now, enter ‘python’ into your command line and then press return/enter. Depending on the version of Python installed, you may need to enter ‘python3’ into your command line and press return/enter. If you enter into the Python interpreter, then Python is installed on your computer already and you can proceed. If you get an error message that says something like "Error: command python not found", you need to install Python. 

To download Python, go to the official Python website, where the latest version can be downloaded: https://www.python.org/downloads/. To use the OpenAI library you need to have at least Python 3.7.1 or newer. If this is your first time installing Python, follow the instructions in this guide: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download.
