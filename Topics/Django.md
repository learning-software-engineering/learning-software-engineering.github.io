# Django

## 0. Prerequisites:
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/): High level general purpose programming language. 
 - [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp): A markup language that is used for the creation of web pages. 
 - [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp): A language used for styling a web page, it often goes hand in hand with HTML.
 

## 1. Introduction
Django is a web framework for Python that allows for the fast development of secure and maintainable websites. It is a versatile, secure, scalable, maintainable, and portable web framework that provides almost everything developers need to build various types of websites. Django also has extensive and up-to-date documentation, it can be extended and its design allows it to be scaled for more website traffic. Django's built-in security measures help developers avoid security mistakes that may occur during the development of a website. Finally, Django is set up in a way that encourages maintainable and reusable code by using components and the grouping of functionality.

## 2. Set-Up

 A good resource for setting up a Django project can be found [here](https://realpython.com/django-setup/). If you are having trouble with the virtual environment, more information about virtual environments can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

 ## 3. How it Works

For an in-depth guide with specifics on how to build a Django app can be visit [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/). This resource will explain more about the functionality of the individual django components and how to set up a basic project. 

 ## 4. Basic Templates

 None of the instructions above will result in anything visible on the front end other than the admin page. To change this Django uses templates. Templates are HTML files with Django syntax that is similar to python allowing the user to create loops, if statements, and other blocks of code usually not possible in HTML. Information about templates can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/fr/2.2/topics/templates/).

 

## 5. Getting the most out of Django

There are several Django extensions and frameworks that allow the user to truly get the most out of Django.

Once a user has finished building their project locally, they may want to deploy their application. An easy and free way to do it is with Heroku. A tutorial of which can be found [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-python).

The [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful toolkit for building web APIs. It includes features such as serialization and authentication and also allows the user to implement JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular.

For users looking to scale their applications, they can look at [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/) as a way to process a large number of messages.
