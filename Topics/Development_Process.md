## SOLID PRINCIPLES: 

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym that represents a set of five very important software development principles which lead to code that is easier to read, maintain, and extend, leading to higher-quality software that is easier to evolve over time.

The SOLID principles are:

 - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should only have one cause to change, according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). According to this theory, a class ought to have just one duty, which implies that there ought to be just one motivation for change. This makes the class more understandable, maintainable, and reuseable as well as more flexible.

 - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be available for extension but closed for modification, according to the available/Closed Principle (OCP). According to this principle, a system should be able to introduce new functionality without requiring changes to the existing code. Interfaces, polymorphism, and generalization are used to accomplish this.

 - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be able to be used in place of their parent types. According to this concept, it should be possible to swap out objects from a superclass for objects from a subclass without having any negative effects on the program's correctness. This necessitates abiding by the superclass's compact.

 - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle states that a client should not be forced to implement an interface if it does not use all of the methods defined by the interface. This helps to avoid the creation of fat interfaces, which are interfaces that contain more methods than the client needs.

 - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle suggests that classes should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, which makes the system more flexible and easier to modify.
