## SOLID PRINCIPLES:

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym that represents a set of five very important software development principles which lead to code that is easier to read, maintain, and extend, leading to higher-quality software that is easier to evolve over time.

The SOLID principles are:

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
- A class should only have one cause to change, according to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). According to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), each class or module should focus on a single concern, ensuring ease of understanding and modification. 

- **Advantage**:  This principle promotes maintainability by isolating responsibilities, reducing potential bugs caused by interconnected changes. Each class or module focuses on a single concern, making it easier to understand, test, and modify. 

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be available for extension but closed for modification, according to the available/Closed Principle (OCP). It means system should be able to introduce new functionality without requiring changes to the existing code. Interfaces, polymorphism, and generalization are used to accomplish this.

- **Advantage**: OCP achieves stability by encouraging developers to create adaptable and scalable systems that accommodate changes through extensions rather than direct modifications. This promotes a more stable codebase and reduces the risk of introducing bugs in previously functioning code.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
-  Subtypes must be able to be used in place of their parent types. According to this concept, it should be possible to swap out objects from a superclass for objects from a subclass without having any negative effects on the program's correctness. This necessitates abiding by the superclass's compact.

- **Advantage**: This principle fosters code reusability and allows for easier substitution of objects within the same inheritance tree. It simplifies maintenance, reducing the need for extensive modifications when introducing new objects or making alterations within the hierarchy. It ensures that system evolution remains agile and manageable without causing extensive disruptions to the existing codebase.

A closer look at the LSP: [LSP](./Development_Process/LSP.md)

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- This principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one large interface, it's better to have multiple smaller, specific interfaces that cater to the exact needs of the clients.

- **Advantage**: Promotes flexibility and avoids unnecessary dependencies. This helps to avoid the creation of fat interfaces, which are interfaces that contain more methods than the client needs. Ultimately, ISP encourages a modular and precise approach to interface construction, contributing to better software architecture and maintainability.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle suggests that classes should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, which makes the system more flexible and easier to modify.

- **Advantage**: Encourages loose coupling and easier maintenance of the system. This facilitates easier modifications, replacements, and testing, as changes in low-level modules don’t affect the higher-level ones.

## Restaurant example of each principle

#### SRP
Consider a **Chef** in a restaurant. Initially, the chef might handle multiple responsibilities: preparing dishes, managing inventory, and overseeing kitchen hygiene. Adhering to SRP, distinct roles are established. The chef focuses solely on cooking, while inventory management becomes the responsibility of a dedicated inventory manager. 

#### OCP
Suppose a restaurant offers a fixed menu, and every addition or modification requires altering the entire menu preparation process. Adhering to OCP, the menu system can be designed with a base menu class that remains closed for modification. New dishes or changes are introduced via an extension, such as a SpecialsMenu class, allowing additions without altering the existing menu. This principle enables the restaurant to introduce seasonal or daily specials without affecting the core menu.

#### LSP
Imagine a scenario where the restaurant's system expects all orders to be instances of a generic Order class. Adhering to LSP, any specialized order, like a delivery order, dine-in order, or takeaway order, should be substitutable for a standard order without breaking the system's functionality. Each specific order type should adhere to the expected behavior of the generic Order class, ensuring seamless substitution.

#### ISP
Consider a system where all employees (servers, chefs, and cleaners) are expected to use the same comprehensive Employee interface, including methods for serving tables, cooking dishes, and cleaning. Adhering to ISP, distinct interfaces are established for each role: ServerInterface, ChefInterface, and CleanerInterface. This segregation ensures that each role implements only the methods relevant to their responsibilities, preventing unnecessary method implementations.

#### DIP
Suppose the restaurant's ordering system directly depends on specific external services for payment processing and inventory updates. Adhering to DIP, the system can depend on abstract interfaces like PaymentProcessor and InventoryService, allowing flexibility to switch between different payment processors or inventory management systems without directly impacting the core ordering system. This abstraction and dependency on interfaces rather than concrete implementations facilitate adaptability and system maintenance.

## Clean Architecture:

A system's design that divides it into logical parts and specifies how those parts may communicate with one another is referred to as clean architecture. The objective is to make the software system easier to design, deploy, operate, and maintain while still keeping as many options open  for as long as possible.

Clean Architecture works on the well-defined division of layers. It is important to understand what the different layers are and which layers are allowed to interact with each other. The independence that clean architecute introduced to the a software system is vital since it reduces dependancies within the system. In clean architecture, the elements of the inner most layers should not have any information about the outermost layers. Anything declared in an outer layer must not be used anywhere within the inner layer of the code.

Some of the layers are (Simplified):

- Business Rules:

  - Entity: A component of our computer system that represents a condensed set of critical business rules that are applied to crucial business data.
  - Use Case: Gives specifics on the input the user must supply and the output the system must deliver to the user. Additionally, it includes the processing steps required to create the result.

- Entities: Contains functions, variables, and other structures that hold the main objectives of our application, they must be general and have the highest level of rules.
- Interface Adaptors: Responsible for communicating between the layers, takes data in and transforms it such that it can be sent to lower levels.
- Framworks and Drivers: This section contains frameworks and databases responsible for communicating with the interface adapters.

This is only a simplification of what "Clean Architecture" is; the topic is so vast that there have been texts that have been dedicated to this topic. Some resources that can be beneficial in understanding and clearing up any doubts about the topic have been linked below.
