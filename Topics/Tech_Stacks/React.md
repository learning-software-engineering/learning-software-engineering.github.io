## Tech Stacks

### React Overview
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces. This component-based architecture allows engineers to quickly prototype and develop complex applications easily by modularizing common functionalities into discrete, reusable UI components, whilst boasting a large user base full of freely available component libraries. Beyond this, React there's much more to learn about React, such as its virtual DOM, JSX, and a full mobile framework in React Native, and much more -- so much more that it can be [overwhelming](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/). 

To help ease the learning curve, below you'll find a variety of resources to reference while learning and components and libraries to use with React. 

### React Learning Resources

JavaScript frameworks tutorial provided by Microsoft. Useful readings, but not necessary to learn React. 

### Useful React Tools and Libraries

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
Allows you to set up your React applications using a single command without having to configure many build tools. Provides a lot of useful functionality like instant reloads and optimizations for deployment; is the "official" React solution.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
Another quickstart build tool for setting up your environment; an alternative to Create React App, [Vite is generally faster than Create React App](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/react-build-tools-create-react-app-with-vite-vs-cra-tool). 

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
A popular and robust framework that allows server-side rendering and static website generation. 

[usehooks-ts](https://usehooks-ts.com/)
A React library of useful hooks that go well beyond those built into React. Don't reinvent the wheel! usehooks offers over forty ready-to-use hooks such as [useEffectOnce](https://usehooks-ts.com/react-hook/use-effect-once) and [useInterval](https://usehooks-ts.com/react-hook/use-interval). 

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
The official React solution for state management. Redux provides functionality for reducers, advanced debugging tools, and more that will simplify the state management for your app.

[Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
A fully-featured UI library that offers a huge range of common components that are easily styled and based on Google's Material Design.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
Another responsive UI library that allows you to focus on development by handling the design logistics for you.  

### Miscellaneous

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
Host your React websites straight from your Github repo. Website hosting is fairly expensive, so this is here as a free alternative for website deployment for simple applications. Head over to the [Development Process](https://learning-software-engineering.github.io/Topics/Development_Process.html#resources-for-development-process) page for a tutorial on GitHub pages and more. 

[Codepen](https://codepen.io/)
Online development environment to try React out in (among other frontend tools). Great for testing the waters with React and other libraries or languages.

[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/)
An online development environment for frontend, Node.js, and JavaScript.
