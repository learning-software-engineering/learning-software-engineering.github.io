## Tech Stacks

### React Overview
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building component-based user interfaces. This component-based architecture allows engineers to quickly prototype and develop complex applications easily by modularizing common functionalities into discrete, reusable UI **s, and React boasts a large user base full of freely available components libraries. Beyond this, React utilizes a virtual DOM, JSX, React Native, and much more -- so much more that it can be [overwhelming](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-manage-javascript-fatigue/). 

To help ease the learning curve, below you'll find a variety of resources to reference while learning and components and libraries to use with React.
