# `JavaScript`

JavaScript is one of the most fundamental coding languages in responsive web design and web development. It is the component that enhances a well-built HTML/CSS site and allows it to have functionality over just being a static page. The following resources are what I believe to be the best way to get started in the basics of JavaScript and also aquire a grasp of the language beyond the fundamentals.
1. [FreeCodeCamp's course on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) 
    
    This is a free online resource that has many components for learning JavaScript from the very beginning. It starts with a section on Basic JavaScript that explores the language wihtout any other components like HTML/CSS to worry about. It then continues to more complex topics such as REGEX, Debugging, Data Structures and Object Oriented versus Functional Programming, just to name a few. The main benefit to this course is that is offers coding projects at the end for you to work on that not only ascertains that you have learned a lot from the course, but upon completion gives you a certificate for completing the course which could be a good resume boost.
2. [JavaScript codealong](https://youtu.be/M6etynV-IMo) 

    This YouTube video is part of a series on web design by Leon Noel, one of the best coding instructors on YouTube. It has a slow, relaxed pace that allows newer coders to follow along without needing to frequently pause the video. This link is second because it requires prior knowledge of CSS and HTML but is a great gateway to the marriage of those languages with JavaScript in a more realistic example of how one will use the languages in web design.
