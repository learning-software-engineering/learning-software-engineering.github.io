Writing HTML files is your first step in developing web pages. In HTML files, you define the content and layout that makes up a web page.

### Set-up

To begin writing HTML, all you need is a text editor and an internet browser. HTML files have extension ".html". You can use a text editor to create, edit, and save an HTML file, and use a browser to open the file to display web page defined by the file.

Try creating an HTML file consisting of the line "hello" and open it with a browser.
