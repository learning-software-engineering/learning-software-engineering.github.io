# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Writing HTML files is your first step in developing web pages. In HTML files, you can define the content and layout that make up a web page.

### Set-up

To begin writing HTML, all you need is a text editor and an internet browser. HTML files have extension `.html`. You can use a text editor to create, edit, and save an HTML file, and use a browser to open the file to display the web page defined by the file.

Try creating an HTML file consisting of the line `hello` and then open it with a browser.

### Resources

Once you have a text editor and an internet browser, you're ready to learn and develop HTML. The following resource is an easy-to-read and interactive guide on all the fundamentals of HTML. You can learn and reference most of the HTML material you will need from it.

### Note

#### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Conventionally, it's good practice to use HTML files to define only what content goes into a webpage, and not the aesthetic settings of that content. As you pick up HTML, you should also learn CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is used to control the aesthetic settings of content defined in an HTML file, and you can write CSS in separate CSS file (with extension `.css`). See an introduction to CSS here (add link to CSS section). By separating content and styling, we achieve cleaner and more maintainable code.
