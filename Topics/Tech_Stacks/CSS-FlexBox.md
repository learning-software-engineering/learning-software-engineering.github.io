## Introduction

Flexible Box Layout or often known as FlexBox, is a CSS layout model that allows us to organize our website in a simple yet effective way. Before this layout was introduced to CSS, there were four other layout modes, that includes:
-	Inline: To organize texts in our webpage
-	Table: To organize in a 2D-grid based system
-	Block: To organize grouped or sections of our webpage
-	Positioned: To mentioned specific position for items. 

These four layout modes required lots of code to do some simple tasks like “Centering a div”. This is where FlexBox comes in clutch! This not only made coding easier but also opened CSS Webpage-organization to a whole new level.

## How to use FlexBox?

There are two things we need to understand in order to use FlexBox. 
- Flex Container: This container will contain some items from our webpage. This container will also define the organization property of the items combined.
- Flex Item: These can be individual components in our webpage (anywhere from a div, to a nested div).

Before we learn about flex containers, lets talk about flex items. These are any component that is nested or "contained" in our flex container.

In the above pictures, we have four items in our flex-container. These items will appear in the same order we add them in. It is sufficient to know this much about flex items for now. Let us now learn how we can create a Flex Container. We can do so by using  "_Displat: Flex_" property. This simply makes our container *Flex 💪🏻*.

There are lots of other properties that we can play around with in our container such as:
- flex-direction
- flex-wrap
- justify-content
- align-content

These are to name a few properties. These properties can be used to change how we want to oprganize our items (vertically or horizontally), whether we want to center our whole container, whether we want to center our items, how do we want to space the items, etc. The following image shows how we can play around with the flex propoerties to do various tasks:
