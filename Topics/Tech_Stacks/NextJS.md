## Introduction
This guide will help you understand the fundamentals of Next.js, a powerful React framework designed for building modern web applications. Before diving into Next.js, it's recommended to have a basic understanding of React and JavaScript. If you need to brush up on React, please check out our [React page](react).

## What is Next.js
Next.js is a React framework known for simplifying the development of React applications with a focus on server-side rendering, efficient routing, and improved developer experience. Its file-system-based router supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, and error handling. Next.js offers both client-side and server-side rendering, utilizing Client and Server Components for optimized rendering. The framework streamlines data fetching with async/await in Server Components and extends the fetch API for features like request memoization and data caching. Next.js supports various styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS. Furthermore it includes optimizations for images, fonts, and scripts to improve Core Web Vitals and user experience. For these reasons it is a popular choice for building full-stack web applications.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Node.js 18.17 or later. You can install the latest version of Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

To begin using Next.js, you need to set up a new project. To create a project run the following command:

`npx create-next-app@latest`

You will then see some prompts that ask for details of your application. Once this is completed, a new folder with your project name should be created!

If you need to install manually or for a more detailed guide, please follow the official guide on [getting started with Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Next.js Basics
Once your Next.js project is set up, you can start exploring its basic features.

### Components
Next.js utilizes React components. You can create components in the `components` directory and use them throughout your application. This is the same as with standard React apps. Here is an example of a simple component:
```jsx
// components/MyComponent.js
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is a Next.js component!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Pages and Routing
One notable feature of Next.js is the automatic routing of pages. In Next.js, each file inside the `pages` directory becomes a route. For example, a file named `About.tsx` inside `pages` will be accessible at the `/about` route. This simple and intuitive routing system helps you structure your application without having to manually add routes like in standard React apps. Next.js eliminates this complexity by inferring routes from the file system, allowing you to focus on building components and pages rather than handling intricate routing logic.

Furthermore, Next.js supports dynamic routes, allowing you to create pages with dynamic content. For example, a file named `[id].tsx` inside `pages/posts` can match routes like `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, and so on. This enables you to build flexible and dynamic applications. Here is an example directory tree with sample pages.

```
your-nextjs-project
|-- components
|   |-- MyComponent.js
|
|-- pages
|   |-- Home.tsx
|   |-- About.tsx
|   |-- Contact.tsx
|   |-- posts
|       |-- [id].tsx
|
|-- styles
    |-- main.css
```

Compare this to a traditional React app, where you would typically use additional libraries on top of manually defining routes. Here is an example of traditional React routing with the same pages as the above example (without the dynamic pages):

```jsx
import React, {useEffect} from "react";
import "./App.sass";
import {Route, Routes} from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";

function App() {

  return (
    <div className="app-wrapper-wrapper">
      <div className="app-wrapper">
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
          <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Optimizations
#### Code Splitting
Next.js excels in automatic code splitting, a crucial optimization technique. The framework divides your application code into smaller chunks, loading only the code required for the current page. This results in faster initial page loads and improved overall performance.

#### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Optimizations
Next.js supports Server-Side Rendering, a powerful optimization that allows rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client. SSR enhances performance by reducing the client's workload and ensuring that users receive pre-rendered content.

#### Built-in CSS and JavaScript Support
Next.js provides support for CSS and JavaScript, optimizing the loading and execution of these resources. With automatic handling of critical CSS and efficient bundling of JavaScript, Next.js ensures a streamlined and performant application.

#### Image Component Optimization
There are other small optimizations that you can implement in your code, for instance the Image component:

`import Image from 'next/image'`

Since the Image component extends the HTML `<img>` element, you can use the standard HTML attributes such as `src`, `alt`, etc. The Image component will automatically perform optimizations such as size optimizations, faster page loads, and visual stability.

There are many more optimizations the Next.js offers. To learn more, please visit the [optimizing page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing) on the official documentation.

### API Routes
Next.js allows you to create API routes easily. By adding files to the `pages/api` directory, you can define serverless functions that handle API requests. This feature simplifies the development of server-side logic without the need for a dedicated server. Here is an example. Suppose you want to fetch posts from some external source. We can create a new file named `post.js` inside the `pages/api` directory:

```jsx
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://some_external_source.com/posts');
    const posts = await response.json();

    res.status(200).json(posts);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching posts:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
  }
}
```

We can then have a component use this endpoint to fetch the posts:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const PostList = () => {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPosts = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
        const data = await response.json();
        setPosts(data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching posts:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchPosts();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Posts</h2>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default PostList;
```

## Styling in Next.js
Styling in Next.js can be done using various approaches. You can use CSS modules, styled-jsx, or integrate popular styling libraries like Tailwind CSS or SCSS. The choice of styling method depends on your project requirements and personal preferences.
