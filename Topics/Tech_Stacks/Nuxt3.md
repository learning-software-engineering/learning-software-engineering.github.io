If you are looking for tutorials or documentation on creating a Nuxt3 application, be aware that many resources actually teach Nuxt2. It is important to note that Nuxt3 installation and syntax differ significantly from Nuxt2. As I faced this challenge myself, I would like to share a helpful YouTube tutorial that provides step-by-step instructions for creating a Nuxt3 app.

The tutorial link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj3NNlTqIJg&list=PL8HkCX2C5h0XT3xWYn71TlsAAo0kizmVc&index=1

Additionally, you can access further support options, such as a Discord server, by visiting this page: https://nuxt.com/support/solutions.

It's worth mentioning that due to the confusion between Nuxt2 and Nuxt3 documentations online, Nuxt2 has more support and answered questions than Nuxt3. Therefore, you may opt to use Nuxt2 instead. However, keep in mind that installing Nuxt2 takes a longer time, so you should be patient.

If you want to add the Tailwind CSS library to your Nuxt3 app, please follow the instructions in this link: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nuxtjs#3. 
Make sure to select Nuxt3 instead of Nuxt2.

## Why Nuxt?

Nuxt.js  provides server-side rendering, automatic routing, code organization, and pre-configured plugins. It also has a built-In static site generation.
Nuxt 3 comes with several performance improvements, including faster server startup time and smaller bundle sizes.
I think it is a nice tool, especially the auto routing and how flexible you can reuse the components, but it still lacks comprehensive documentation.
