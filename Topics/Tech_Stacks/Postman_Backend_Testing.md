## Testing with Postman
### Creating a workspace
Before starting to test your API, it is best to create a workspace for the 
specific project that you are working on. This way team members can access
and contribute to the test cases. However, if you are short on time you can
jump to the next step "Creating a Collection".
To do this, click on the workspace tab and then click on the 
'Create Workspace' button and name your workspace.
then click on the newly created workspace to write your requests within it.
### Creating a Collection
To send request within this workspace. You need to create a new
collection which will contain all the different requests to your API endpoint.
Create a new Collection by clicking on the '+' that is location next to the 
collection side tab.
### Sending requests
Once you have created the Collection, you can now create your request. 
Do this by expanding the newly created collection on the left panel and clicking on add request
which is highlighted. Copy and paste the request URL of your API into the URL bar.

To add any new requests to your collection, right click on your collection on the left panel and 
select a add request. Alternatively, you can right click on the previously created request
and click Duplicate. This also helps preserve the request variables.
#### POST requests
For POST requests, the request body is required. To include all the data
you must fill the request body.
#### GET requests
For GET requests, the request needs to have header variables included. Click on the 
header tab within the request and add the keys and values. 
### Downloading collection
To export your work, you can right click on the Collection that you have been working on and 
click Export which will prompt you to the version you would like to export. Once selected you can
download the exported file.

### Conclusion
This summary of Postman application showed the basics of creating a collection of requests to test
