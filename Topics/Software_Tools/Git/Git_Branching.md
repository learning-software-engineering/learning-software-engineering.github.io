     * Pointers to specific commit
     * Developer can work on a specific feature or bug fix on a branch before merging with the main branch
  * ```git checkout [BRANCH NAME]```
     * Move to [BRANCH NAME] 
     * ```git checkout -b [BRANCH NAME]```: Create a new branch and check it out at the same time 
  * ```git merge [BRANCH NAME]```
     * Combining branches into a single branch
     * Merging the current branch with [BRANCH NAME]
     * Three possible outcomes, including fast forward merge, recursive merge, merge conflict
  * ```git rebase [BRANCH NAME]```
     * Another way to combine work between branches
     * Move the entire branch to [BRANCH NAME], apply changes on the current branch to [BRANCH NAME]
     * Produce a linear sequence of commit, commit history will be cleaner

* Remote
  * ```git fetch```
     * Download commits from remote that are missing in local repository
