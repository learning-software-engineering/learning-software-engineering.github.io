1. Methodologies & Frameworks
    1. Agile: 
             Agile methodology is an approach to project management that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It is a                set of principles and values that guide the development of software and other products, with the goal of delivering high-quality                      solutions that meet the needs of the customer.

             Agile frameworks are specific methods or approaches that implement the principles and values of agile methodology in a structured way.                Some popular agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP)
        a. Scrum:
                Scrum is an agile framework that focuses on iterative development and a flexible approach to managing tasks and timelines. It                         involves a series of time-boxed sprints, where a cross-functional team works on a set of tasks that are prioritized by the product                   owner.

        b. Kanban: 
                 Kanban is another agile framework that emphasizes continuous delivery and visualizing work in progress. It involves using a Kanban                    board to track the status of tasks and limit work in progress to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks.
        c. XP:
                 Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile framework that emphasizes high-quality software development practices, such as continuous                        testing, frequent releases, and pair programming.
