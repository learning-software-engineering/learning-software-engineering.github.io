# **Introduction to Request for Comments (RFCs)**

The following is an introductory overview of RFCs based on the following 2 articles by Juan Pablo Buriticá:

1. ["A thorough team guide to RFCs"](https://leaddev.com/technical-decision-making/thorough-team-guide-rfcs)
2. ["6 Lessons I learned while implementing technical RFCs as a decision making tool"](https://buriti.ca/6-lessons-i-learned-while-implementing-technical-rfcs-as-a-management-tool-34687dbf46cb)

## **What are RFCs?**

- RFC stands for Request for Comments
- It is a document that acts as a technical proposal for a design, approach or change
- It can outline things like architecture changes, dependencies, assumptions, alternative considerations, etc.
- RFCs are meant to facilitate technical decision-making and increase transparency and collaboration within an organization
- RFCs are usually authored by a few team members and then reviewed by the rest of the team/organization to receive feedback (hence the name “request for comments”)
- An RFC can be understood as “Here is the direction we want to go, are we missing anything?”
- There are 4 general phases in an RFC life cycle
  - Proposal stage: the RFC is drafted
  - Commenting stage: feedback and discussion ensue
  - Decision stage: ideally, the reviewers and the authors are now aligned on the path forward
  - Archive stage: the RFC is archived for future reference

## **Why are RFCs useful?**

For teams in CSC301, good project planning from the start can save enormous amount of time and effort in the later development stages. Although formal documents may be unnecessary, RFCs also provide a great guideline for how to communicate design and implementation decisions to partners. More generally, RFCs are used in the tech industry because of the following benefits: 

- they mitigate the risk of the decision made.
  - RFCs act as a kind of code review but at the planning stage
  - Problems or considerations can be surfaced before resources have been spent
- they facilitate better technical decisions and collaboration.
  - Building software is a social exercise
  - RFCs facilitates communication and decision-making between groups
- they allow for individual contribution and responsibility on all levels.
  - When done right, individuals of all levels in the organization are empowered and encouraged to make impactful decisions while seeking input from others
- they create documentation for future context.
  - An archive of past RFCs act as a record of previous discussions and decisions
- they are an asynchronous process.
  - Multiple RFCs can run in parallel
  - Increases the flexibility of collaborative discussions

## **When to RFC?**

If it crosses your mind that an RFC might be required to make a change or implement a design, it is probably a good idea to make one.

Additionally, an RFC is generally a good idea when:

- You are building something from scratch (new endpoint, component, system, library, application, etc.).
  - (This is definitely something many CSC301 teams will face!)
- You will impact more than one system or other team members.
- You would like to define a contract of interface between clients or systems.
- You are adding a new dependency.
- You are adding or replacing languages or tools to the stack.
- You are in doubt of whether to write one.

## **How to RFC?**

RFCs are a guideline, not a rigid methodology. They are usually tailored to the specific needs of teams and organizations, so multiple variations exist both in the actual document and the surrounding process.

### **Adopting RFCs in a team**

Some considerations when adopting RFCs in a team:

- Success using RFCs isn’t guaranteed – when adopting it for the first time in a team, think of it initially as a collective experiment and reflect on whether:
  - Has using RFCs led to better decisions?
  - Is your team better informed and making decisions faster?
  - Are different groups equally participating in comments?
  - Can the process be lighter while achieving similar outcomes?
- It is usually a good idea to define a time-limit on the commenting stage to avoid it lasting forever.
- What exactly the "decision stage" looks like depends on company implementation. Sometimes, the authors will need formal approval by the reviewers to go ahead with the proposal. However, concerns about limiting individual initiative and freedom might lead an organization to decide to not strictly require permission and instead let the authors decide when they have addressed all feedback.
- The tool you use can vary – some options include collaborative docs (ex. Google Docs, Microsoft Word, etc.), markdown doc in a git repo, a slide presentation, etc.

### **Getting started: RFC templates**

[This article](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/rfcs-and-design-docs/) contains templates from a comprehensive list of companies including Google, Uber, SoundCloud, and more.

Additionally, here is a basic template (credit: ["A thorough team guide to RFCs" by Juan Pablo Buriticá](https://leaddev.com/technical-decision-making/thorough-team-guide-rfcs)) in the following formats:

- [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EM5ORZ8sO-g678jNc2nHMAkGjX5-6DuB6EkhjsNcOXo/edit#)
- [Dropbox paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/RFC-Template-Title--BJJD6B25kkYC_zRXc2q5BxB0Ag-dYS7Oe0SKA0wjqzvuaxsO)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/buritica/RFC-Template-Title-8df1bd0d24b0440486fe133eecdf4a5e)
- [Markdown](https://github.com/buritica/mgt/blob/master/rfc_template.md)

Below are the main sections in the above template. Although these are topics that an RFC would want to address in general, they can be modified based on the specific points the authors want to cover.

1. Title
2. Authors
3. Executive summary
4. Motivation
5. Proposed implementation
6. Metrics and dashboard
7. Drawbacks
8. Alternatives
9. Potential impacts and dependencies
10. Unresolved questions
11. Conclusion

## **Conclusion**

- RFCs can be an effective tool to enhance collaboration, decision-making and software quality
- However, if adopted in the wrong environment or not tailored properly to a team, it can decrease productivity and add unnecessarily to people’s workload
- To read more about common pitfalls and the best way to utilize RFCs, the two articles linked at the top of this page are great sources.
