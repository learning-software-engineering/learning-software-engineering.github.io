By following these steps, you can deploy your frontend project using Vercel CLI, leveraging its simplicity and flexibility for a seamless deployment experience. [For more information, see the Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy).

### Adding Environment Variables

Environment variables are an important part of the project.Here's how you can add environment variables using Vercel CLI:

The `--build-env` option, shorthand `-b`, allows you to provide environment variables to the build step. Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
vercel --build-env KEY1=value1 --build-env KEY2=value2
```

This command sets environment variables KEY1 and KEY2 with the respective values value1 and value2 during the build process.

The --env option, shorthand -e, allows you to provide environment variables at runtime. Here's an example:

```bash
vercel --env KEY1=value1 --env KEY2=value2
```

This command sets environment variables KEY1 and KEY2 with the respective values value1 and value2 during runtime.

For more CLI usages, refer to [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy).

## Security Best Practices for Deploying on Vercel

When deploying applications on Vercel, ensuring the security of your frontend and its data is paramount. Here are key practices to help you safeguard your deployments:

### Environment Variables
- Store sensitive information such as API keys, database URIs, and secret tokens in environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your application code. Vercel supports environment variables, making it easy to manage sensitive data securely.
- Always encrypt sensitive information before storing it. Vercel encrypts environment variables at rest, but it's crucial to encrypt them before transmission or use additional layers of encryption for highly sensitive data.
- Limit access to environment variables to those who absolutely need it. Use Vercel's team management features to control who can view or modify environment variables.

### HTTPS Enforcement
- Vercel automatically provides HTTPS for all deployments, ensuring data transmitted between your application and its users is encrypted. Always use HTTPS to protect your application from man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Consider implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers to prevent downgrade attacks and ensure secure connections.

### Access Control
- Ensure that only authorized users can access your Vercel account and projects. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security.
- Use Vercelâ€™s edge functions to implement rate limiting, protecting your application from brute force and denial-of-service attacks.

### Security Headers
- Utilize HTTP security headers to add another layer of protection for your web applications against common vulnerabilities and attacks. This includes headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, and others.
- A CSP helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. Define a CSP that specifies which domains are allowed to execute scripts, load resources, and so forth.
- Start with CSP in report-only mode to understand its impact on your application without blocking legitimate resources.

### Regularly Update Dependencies
- Keep all your project dependencies up to date. This includes the libraries and frameworks your application uses. Outdated dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
- Example (update all dependencies in package.json):
```bash
npm update
```
