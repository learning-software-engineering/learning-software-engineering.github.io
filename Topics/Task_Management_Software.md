<p>4. Navigation: The Jira dashboard provides an overview of ongoing tasks, project progress, and important announcements. The dashboard layout is customizable according to your preferences.</p>

<h2>2. Core Features of Jira</h2>
<h3>a. Issue Tracking</h3>
<h4>Issue types:</h4>
<p>In Jira, issues are the core of project management. To effectively track and manage work, it is crucial to understand the various issue types that Jira offers. Each Jira product comes with default issue types to suit the needs of your projects and teams, such as:</p>
<p>1. Story: a feature or requirement from the user’s perspective, written in non-technical language so that anyone involved in the project can understand.</p>
<p>2. Task: work items that are not directly related to a user requirement but still must be completed, like the upgrading of a server or the implementation of a function.</p>
<p>3. Bug: a problem which impairs or prevents the functions of a product.</p>
<p>4. Subtask: the child of another issue, and is used to break down stories, tasks, or bugs into individually manageable pieces of work.</p>
<p>5. Epic: the parent issue that groups stories, tasks, and bugs to capture a large, holistic body of work</p>
<p>Aside from using the default suggested issue types, you can create and customize your issue types to match any method of project management you want. To learn more about the different issue types and their use cases, see this guide: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-types/ 
</p>

<h4>Workflows:</h4>
<p>Workflows in Jira define the lifecycle of an issue, guiding it from creation to completion. Jira's flexibility allows users to customize workflows based on their project's unique requirements. A typical workflow includes stages like "To Do," "In Progress," "In Review," and "Done." Understanding how to tailor workflows empowers teams to align Jira with their specific development processes.</p>

<p>To create or modify workflows, navigate to the Jira settings and locate the Workflow section. From here, you can design custom workflows or modify existing ones to match your team's collaboration style.</p>

Best Practices:
* Tailor issue types and workflows to align with your project's needs.
* Leverage epics to manage and visualize larger bodies of work.
* Regularly review and optimize workflows based on team feedback.
<p>By mastering issue types and workflows, you'll unlock Jira's potential for streamlined project management and efficient collaboration.</p>

<h3>b. Agile boards</h3>
<h4>Setting up Agile boards</h4>
<p>Jira’s Agile boards are a dynamic feature for both Scrum and Kanban methodologies. To set up these boards, see below:</p>
<p>1. Create a new board and select your board type (either Scrum or Kanban).
  
    a. Scrum manages issues in sprints and best suits teams who deliver on a regular schedule.
    b. On the other hand, Kanban manages issues in a continuous flow and best suits teams to control work volume from a backlog.</p>
    
<p>2. Set up your board by configuring the board settings, such as the columns based on your workflow (e.g. To Do, In Progress, Done) and filters that determine which issues appear on the board.</p>

<p>For further details regarding board creation, see the below resources:</p>

# Examples of Modern Task Management Methodologies
<h2>Agile</h2>
<p>Agile is a task management methodology that is widely used in modern software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Agile methodology focuses on delivering software features in small increments, which are known as sprints or iterations. At the start of each sprint, the team identifies the tasks that need to be completed and assigns them to team members. The team then works together to complete the tasks within the sprint period. The detailed executions may differ in different teams and projects, but there are several key principles to follow:</p>
  <p>1.Prioritizing tasks based on customer value: Agile task management focuses on delivering the highest value features first, rather than trying to complete all tasks   at once.</p>
  <p>2.Collaboration and communication: Agile emphasizes close collaboration between team members, with frequent meetings and communication to ensure that everyone is on   the same page.</p>
  <p>3.Iterative development: Agile tasks are completed in small iterations(sprints), allowing for continuous feedback and improvement.</p>
  <p>4.Flexibility: Agile recognizes that requirements and priorities are subject to be changed, and allows for adjustments throughout the project.</p>
<p>The number of teams practicing agile in organizations has grown significantly in the past years, and agile knowledge has become a factor of consideration in recruiting processes. </p>

</p>
<h2>Waterfall</h2>
<p>
Waterfall is a traditional project management methodology that involves a linear, sequential approach to task management. In this approach, tasks are completed in a specific order, with each task depending on the completion of the previous task. While it is very useful for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear plan, it is much less flexible than Agile, and is also less popular in modern software development.</p>
